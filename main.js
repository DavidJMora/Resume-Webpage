    bio: "Once upon a time I got into a fight with my pet snake. Within seconds it was obvious I would succumb to its speed and versatility. Then I was given a stroke of luck and the Koolaid Man bursted through my wall and a piece of random debris knocked the snake out. I quickly tied it into a pretzel and laid claim to my domain. Afterwards, I made a business model on the supply and demand for pretzel fried snakes. Unfortunately none such market existed and so now I have begun my quest on manipulating the world's population into liking my food. Wish me luck.",
